        Mobile Terms of Service
      </div>
      <div class="terms-paragraph">
        The Lorenzo Tax mobile message service (the "Service") is operated by Lorenzo Tax (“Lorenzo Tax”, “we”, or “us”). Your
        use of the Service constitutes your agreement to these terms and conditions (“Mobile Terms”). We may modify or cancel
        the Service or any of its features without notice. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also modify these
        Mobile Terms at any time and your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such changes shall
        constitute your acceptance of such changes.
        <br>
        <br>
        By consenting to Lorenzo Tax’s SMS/text messaging service, you agree to receive recurring SMS/text messages from and on
        behalf of Lorenzo Tax through your wireless provider to the mobile number you provided, even if your mobile number is
        registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list. Text messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing
        system or other technology. Service-related messages may include updates, alerts, and information (e.g., order updates,
        account alerts, etc.). Promotional messages may include promotions, specials, and other marketing offers (e.g., cart
        reminders).
        <br><br>
        You understand that you do not have to sign up for this program in order to make any purchases, and your consent is not
        a condition of any purchase with Lorenzo Tax. Your participation in this program is completely voluntary.
        <br><br>
        We do not charge for the Service, but you are responsible for all charges and fees associated with text messaging
        imposed by your wireless provider. Message frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. Check your mobile plan
        and contact your wireless provider for details. You are solely responsible for all charges related to SMS/text messages,
        including charges from your wireless provider.

        You may opt-out of the Service at any time. Text the single keyword command STOP to +18337180271 or click the
        unsubscribe link (where available) in any text message to cancel. You'll receive a one-time opt-out confirmation text
        message. No further messages will be sent to your mobile device, unless initiated by you. If you have subscribed to
        other Lorenzo Tax mobile message programs and wish to cancel, except where applicable law requires otherwise, you will
        need to opt out separately from those programs by following the instructions provided in their respective mobile terms.
        <br><br>
        For Service support or assistance, text HELP to +18337180271 or email info@lorenzotax.com.
        <br><br>
        We may change any short code or telephone number we use to operate the Service at any time and will notify you of these
        changes. You acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP or HELP requests, you send to a short code or telephone
        number we have changed may not be received and we will not be responsible for honoring requests made in such messages.
        <br><br>
        The wireless carriers supported by the Service are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. You agree to provide
        us with a valid mobile number. If you get a new mobile number, you will need to sign up for the program with your new
        number.
        <br><br>
        To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that we will not be liable for failed, delayed, or misdirected
